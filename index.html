<h1>Rail Towns, Dunedin</h1>

<p>The Rail Towns project is a proposal for 9 dense railway suburbs from Dunedin to Mosgiel. The dense suburbs will be
    lively, infrastructure efficient, and create many new homes and destinations. The rail service will pay for itself
    with fares and opt-in rates borne solely by new developments.</p>
<p>In contrast to conventional development which often harms neighbours and ratepayers, Rail Towns are designed to
    benefit the community with minimal harm. New Rail Towns will be much more efficient than suburban sprawl on the the
    edges of the city, and will produce minimal traffic and infrastructure burden. Infill in old Rail Towns will be less
    harmful and contentious than usual infill, as the new developments disproportionately subsidise public transport,
    making traffic better, not worse.</p>

        // This function is not designed around timetable simplicity or legibility, or even utility for the passengers.
        // The purpose of the function is to create a rail network that can dynamically expand while concretely benefiting all stakeholders.
        // The main goal is to ensure that subsidies are divided so that:
        // - New development cannot make any suburb worse off in terms of rates paid or services recieved
        // - Regardless of the order of development, if the result of development is the same, the subsidies and serviecs are the same
        //
        // The latter is handled by making the services a function of the subsidies and a few parameters, rather
        // than a function of the past state of the network.
        // The former can probably be achieved by many algorithms, ours is the following:
        // - Consider a service with that stops at all stations with money left to spend
        // - Divide the cost of the service such that:
        //     - each suburb pays for the stopping time at that station
        //     - the cost of service along each section is divided equally by suburbs whose residents cross that section to reach town
        //     - the cost of each section is proportional to its length
        // - Order as many of these services as possible until a suburb runs out of money
        // - Repeat
        // 
        // This scheme ensures that:
        // - New stations in the middle of the line cover their marginal costs (stop time)
        // - New stations at the end of the line cover their marginal costs (stop time and new section cost)
        // - New development/subsidies at existing stations does not decrease service for any station
