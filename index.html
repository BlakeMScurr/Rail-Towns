<h1>Rail Towns, Dunedin</h1>

<p>The Rail Towns project is a proposal for 9 dense railway suburbs from Dunedin to Mosgiel. The dense suburbs will be lively, infrastructure efficient, and create many new homes and destinations. The rail service will pay for itself with fares and opt-in rates borne solely by new developments.</p>
<p>In contrast to conventional development which often harms neighbours and ratepayers, Rail Towns are designed to benefit the community with minimal harm. New Rail Towns will be much more efficient than suburban sprawl on the the edges of the city, and will produce minimal traffic and infrastructure burden. Infill in old Rail Towns will be less harmful and contentious than usual infill, as the new developments disproportionately subsidise public transport, making traffic better, not worse.</p>
