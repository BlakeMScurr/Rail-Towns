Rail Towns is an advocacy project run by me, Blake McAlevey-Scurr.

It's currently not incorported or official in any legal sense. I intend for it to be a non-profit of for the first few years of its life while advocating for my particular vision of housing in Dunedin. Eventually I would like to transition this to a for profit enterprise, benefiting from some of the newly buildable land we create.
