  Dunedin's city centre could be far better and denser, but regulation are holding it back.
---

The most efficient place to build housing (or anything else) is the city centre. There is more demand for central apartments than for suburban houses (TODO: substantiate), and there is central development is much better for the public good as apartment dwellers generate less traffic, take less parking, and cost less in infrastructure maintainence.

There are two kinds of regulations holding back the centre city: height restrictions, and heritage restrictions.

## Height

Resolving height restrictions is simple, to a degree. Most centre city landowners would be happy if the height limit were increased, so that they would be able to build. This is in sharp contrast to increasing height regulations in the suburbs, which is more subtle as people are concerned with the the negative externalities of density, as opposed to the positive ones.

If necessary, we could employ a suburban style of YIMBY height regulation: the neighbour's veto, which we've described elsewhere (TODO: link).

There would still be a maximum height according to regulations, as there is public interest in the skyline. In particular, the 2GP says the views from hill suburbs are of significant importance (TODO: link). However, since we already have 12 storey buildings, and the height limits are 2-4 in the centre of the city, there is a lot of room for increase without significantly impacting views.

## Heritage

Heritage is a much more subtle problem.

In Dunedin City Council meetings on heritage protections, we typically see a tension between the desire to protect heritage buildings for the public good on one hand, and the desire to protect rights of land owners and developers on the other.

### Heritage vs Housing

As far as we can tell, people want to preserve heritage buildings for aesthetic and historical reasons. This is reasonable as living in a more beautiful city improves quality of life significantly, which is obvious by reflection, and has been substantiated quantitatively (TODO: cite). Preservation for historical reasons is reasonable too, as much of the public clearly feels that it's in their interest to live in a city that respects its rich history.

Protecting the right to develop is also extremely important, and not just for the developer and land owner. As we've established (TODO: link), there is a housing crisis in Dunedin, and the city centre is an extremely good place to build. Firstly, there a high demand to live there, close to the university and the amenities of the city. You can see this by looking at the rent cost per square metre of floor space, which shows that city centre living is more in demand than suburban living. Secondly, housing in the city centre is much better for the general public due to externalities: apartment dwellers generally don't drive to work, so they generate far less traffic on average, meaning faster travel, less noise and air pollution, and less road danger for others; they might not even own a car, so the will not take up any parking; the use less infrastructure per person, such as stormwater which stays constant as building height increases, or drinking and waste water where the capacity of pipes scales with building height but length of pipes stays constant, similarly for electricity and fibre.

### Objective Regulations for Subjective Problems

The tension between heritage and development is deep, but it can be resolved or at least improved.

It's important to understand that the ends that heritage regulations pursue are subjective. Subjectivity in aesthetics and ethics is a big topic, but for our purposes it's enough to note that reasonable people can disagree wildly on the beauty of a building, or the importance of some historical artifact. Some people prefer classical highly decorated architecture, while others prefer modernism. Some people prefer old buildings, while others prefer new.

This is not to say it's impossible to evaluate the aesthetic or historical importance of a building. But we should be wary of anyone trying to be objective, unless they have extreme philosophical sophistication. Our 2GP regulations unfortunately fall into this trap.

Naturally, since regulations are intended to be upheld by impartial Council staff, they generally need to be objective. For example, consider the rule "character contributing buildings can be demolished and replaced by more beautiful buildings." If this could be enforced well, then is would be a win for both aesthetics and development, as developers would now enjoy a right to build so long as they can meet a certain standard, and the aesthetics of the public realm could only improve. However, it's not a desirable rule because we know that would rely on the subjective taste of whatever bureaucrat happened to be granting resource consent, therefore the rule would provide no certainty either for heritage protection or development rights.

Instead of being subjective, the heritage rules in the 2GP are comprised of highly specific enforcable objective standards. In general, though the justification (TODO: what's the actual word for the prelude to the rules that gives the purpose?) in the rules alludes to the need to allow improvement, the actual enforcable text of the rules are designed as though the highest possible achievement for a building is to attain its former glory. Note that any alteration or demolition requires resource consent, including those required by other regulations such as for earthquake strengthening purposes (TODO: cite) (TODO: do a more thorough re-reading of the rules - are improvements actually discouraged?). It's also instructive to read the submission by Heritage New Zealand, who made more submissions to these rules than than anyone (TODO: check this and use the most extreme justifiable language) and likely had an outsized influence - he (TODO: give name) argued that there should even be resource consents for restoration work because a property owner needs oversight to ensure that they're restoring as faithfully as possible to the most original possible state.

### A Subjective Process

Instead of writing specific objective rules, we propose a subjective process akin to a jury. The heritage rules would be largely stripped of their content and massively simplified and replaced by a rule to the effect of:

> Heritage protected and character contributing buildings can be demolished or altered in any way, as long as a jury of randomly sampled residents agrees that change would improve the public realm, and that the agreement is statstically significant enough to imply with 90% confidence that the population of Dunedin agrees.

This kind of process would account for the subjective will of the public in far greater detail than any set of specific rules arising from a political process, and ensures a land owner has a right to develop, provided they have a sufficient grasp on the public's opinion of quality.

#### Uncertainty

Preservationists are likely afraid of the uncertainty that such a rule entails, and some people probably derive comfort from knowing that the buildings they cherish aren't allowed to change. This is a reasonable desire that we would like to accomodate.

Therefore, do not advocate that this rule should apply to those few buildings on Heritage New Zealand's list (TODO: link) of which there are 55 (TODO: check and cite) of very high quality like the Dunedin Railway Station, University Clock Tower, or Otago Boy's Main Building (TODO: check naming). However, we do advocate that the 2000 (TODO: check and link) other buildings being restricted/proteceted should be subject to the new rule. This compromise hopefully suits both sides of the heritage vs housing tension, as most of the sentimental value probably resides in those 55 (TODO: check) buildings, whereas the vast majority of the development potential resides in the remaining 2000 (TODO: check).

However, we would caution those preservationists against putting too much faith in the comfort of strict rules. No rule, indeed no system whatsoever can halt change - we all have to contend with entropy. All buildings crumble over time, our current strict rules haven't been able to stop that (TODO: link cases), and more strictness likely wouldn't help.

#### Advocacy

Sometimes, the good qualities of a building are not immediately apparent, especially its historical value. Likewise, the benefits of a proposed development are not obvious. So trials should allow developers and preservations to both make their case.

This should actually be exciting to preservationists, as currently, the only way to protect a building is to make submissions about regulations, whereas in a jury system, preservationists can make their case directly as it pertains to the specific buildings they want to protect. Whereas now we rely on Council staff to both reserach and judge the historical value of a building, under the jury system anyone with an interest will be able to make sure their case is heard.

#### Allowed Criteria

The goal of the rule is to ensure that Pareto improvements (TODO: link to my own page about this) are possible, which in this case means that we should allow any change that increases both the public and private value of a building. That being the case, we should allow the jury members to define the public good broadly to include both historical, sentimenal, and aesthetic value of a building. But it's crucial that we don't allow them to consider any individual private interest such as the profit of the developers, the benefit of the tenants, or the shading of the neighbours. The jury are not there to act as judge, but rather to gague the subjective value to the public at large and determine whether a change would be better or worse on that basis.

So we must restrict the advocates on either side to only argue in the general public interest. For example, they can argue that it's in the interest of the passersby to have a beautiful new facade, or an old historical one, or some new greenspace, or not to be shaded in the winter by a tall building etc. Note that this is a superset of what we normally consider to be heritage values. We could compromise with preservationists and further restrict the available arguments to only aesthetics and historical significance, but that would not be in the public interest as it would preclude a huge range of ways developers could make a new building attractive to the public, such as a fully open public space on the ground floor, or water fountains, or heated public seating, or any number of possible creative public goods that would be incentivised by a more general process.

Note that in order to prevent an incentive towards neglect, it is reasonable that the preservationist can argue that the proposed building is worse than the current building if it were restored to its original condition, rather than comparing it to the current building as is.

#### Jury Selection

Jury selection is a complex logistical issue that we don't have a particular opinion on, but have some suggestions.

On one hand we could tap into the existing criminal jury system (such a system allegdly exists in Western Australia (TODO: cite Andres Duany in his video on Tampa or maybe it was some other sunbelt city)). This has the logistical advantage of already being set up, and it's probably the most representative method we have. Further, the people would already be there in person, and we could set up in a side room at the court. On the downside, it's based on force which is ethically dubious in tame matters like resource consents. Also, it's not clear that the jury system can legally be used for this.

Another alternative is random selection by mail. We could send out a letter to random addresses and ask them to participate. We could have some kind of first-in-first-served verification process such that we are guaranteed the correct number, perhaps the verification could work by phone or a website.

Finally we could have a pool of volunteers who are randomly selected for each case. This would probably be the smoothest method, as much of the process could be done online, and everyone involved would gladly volunteer. However, it's also the most subject to bias.

#### Who Pays?

As with most consents, the applicant can pay for this process. (TODO: read and link https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/services/resource-consents/fees#landuse if applicable as expected). This money should cover the costs of the jury, and the Council staff member who oversees the process. 

However, part of the cost is actually incurred by the objector. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the objectors should also pay for the time of the jury and Council staff for that portion where their argument is heard. This is necessary to ensure that there is no "exploit/attack" where objectors fill the room and occupy a large amount of time that the applicant will have to pay for - i.e., fillibustering. Paying for time upfront also guarantees a trial of a fixed length.

It would also be possible tohave the applicant reimburse objectors if the application fails - however, that also opens an attack where objectors make the applicant pay an unbounded amount of money. Perhaps that reimbursement should be capped at the cost of time for the applicant, not the cost of time of the objectors - i.e., the objectors may only be reminbursed for the time they spent equal to the applicant.

##### Unobjected

A really nice efficiency of this method, would be to allow changes that are not objected to. That is, there could be an online list of projects that are proposed, and they only go to trial if someone objects within, say, 4 weeks. Moreover, the objector would have to pay for the time to have their argument heard. Note that there's a risk of 1000s of projects going through at once such that potential objectors don't have time to object, so this queue could also be limited to say, one new project per day, for example.

The final result of this is that projects that are obviously in the public interest go through without needing a lengthy process, while objectionable projects can be stopped by anyone who has a problem with them and a good argument.

#### Enforcement

Just as with any resource consent, there must be a process for ensuring that only the approved changes were made. We can simply follow the existing DCC process. (TODO: how does that work right now?)

#### Statistics

(TODO: calculate the number of people required for 90% confidence)

#### Repitition

(TODO: note that consents on the same property must be put through a screening process to ensure they've changed significantly, or to ensure that the confidence required is higher)
