  More problems with the DCC's housing capacity assessment.
---

As we outlined [here](/posts/capacity), the DCC's housing capacity assessment cannot be used to determine how much housing capacity we should allow. This is a supplementary post describing other flaws in the assessment that should call it into question.

## Table of Contents

There are a number of other errors that call the assessment into question, but are not crucial for understanding that the assessment only provides a lower limit on how much capacity should be provdied.

### Construction/Consent Ratio

On page 2 (section 2.1), the assessment makes a flawed argument for the idea that planning constraints aren't important. This is in the introduction, and is not central to the thesis of the assessment:

> Constructed homes peaked at 419 over the year to September 2022, far below
consented rates [of 641]. This suggests that constraints in the construction industry had a more significant
impact on housing supply than planning decisions.

We agree that the 222 consented by unconstructed homes were probably larglely due to constraints in the construction industry, but this doesn't say anything about the number of homes that weren't constructed due to planning decisions. Indeed, we believe that planning decisions had a far greater impact.

To justify its claim, the assessment would have to estimate the number of homes not built due to planning decisions and show it was significantly less than 222. To estimate the effect of planning restrictions we can consider how many homes would be built if restrictions were totally lifted. Imagine property owners were allowed to build as much as they like across Dunedin and Mosgiel - how much extra housing would be built? It would take a full study to estimate this, but we hope you agree that if all the best land were suddenly available to build at any height, far more than 222 extra homes would be built. Even if you disagree with our estimate, it's clear that the assessment failed to justify its claim.

### Consumer Demand

Curiously, when determining the demand for housing, the assessment looks at the composition of recently constructed buildings as well as a consumer demand study:

> While the survey suggested that 31% of total demand would be for attached homes, 66% of recently consented homes in the urban environment have been attached typologies, up from 24% in 2019. To reflect this trend, adjustments have been made to the composition of expected demand. The final approach balances the need to reflect current market conditions and a need to avoid putting too much weight on short-term trends. It achieves this by using the halfway point between the Housing Weâ€™d Choose findings (31% attached) and the current composition of building consents (66% attached).

The assessment doesn't justify this at all. Why would you expect consents to match demand? Why is a consumer demand study not sufficient? Why "choose the halfway point" between the two rather than some other mathematical operation? If a survey said 0% of people prefered apartments, but apartments were 100% of the housing consented, is it really reasonable to call 50% the true demand?

To [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) their approach, perhaps they thought that the consents represent the [revealed preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference) of the market. Indeed, there's no guarantee that a survey represents true preferences. Unfortunately, looking at consents is *extremely* unlikely to show revealed preferences, as consents are largely determined by planning rules, available land, the building industry, and macroeconomic conditions. There is one way to link consents to true preferences: developers want to build housing that people want in order to be profitable, and may know market preferences better than a survey. However, this seems unlikely to override all the other effects on consents to the point where consents could be used as an indication of preference.

Less charitably, the assessment might have used this halfway point to downplay the need for detatched housing, which is harder for councils to consent due.
