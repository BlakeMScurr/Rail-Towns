  Wingatui can become Dunedin's best and most vibrant township.
---

Wingatui is the best place for a train service in Dunedin. It has the only well-preserved suburban station in Dunedin, its geography makes rail faster than driving, and it has growth potential on all sides.

We hope to convince Wingatui residents to support a new rail service, and the changes neccessary to make that happen.

## Why Have Rail?

A train will get Wingatui residents to town faster than a car, and will increase property values.

### Speed

In 1973, express trains went from Wingatui to Dunedin Railway Station in 15 minutes. Today, a car [takes 20 minutes](/assets/car_from_wingatui.png) not including parking! A modern train might take only 12 minutes (Wingatui to Dunedin [is 12km](/assets/distance_to_wingatui.png) and 10km from Wellington to Petone takes 11 minutes).

Consider how nice it would be to commute to town without having to drive or park in 12 minutes! Consider the freedom that children, elderly, and other non-drivers would experience due to the train.

### Property Values

Firstly, property values increase due to proximity to public transport. For example, in the UK, properties near a train station have a [10% higher value](https://www.struttandparker.com/knowledge-and-research/how-new-transport-infrastructure-affects-property-prices-and-saleability#:~:text=Research%20by%20Nationwide%20shows%20that,reflected%20in%20other%20large%20cities) than comparable properties.

But much more importantly, trains will let us rezone Wingatui for high density - the DCC rejects most housing developments because they generate traffic, but dense housing around a train station caters to a car-free lifestyle. Imagine, for example, several townhouses or an apartment block instead of a single family home. This should radically increase the value of land in Wingatui.

## Why Not Have Rail?

Upzoning is essential to justify and pay for any rail service, and we acknowledge that this would be a radical change to your suburb.

You might oppose developments due to shading, noise, privacy, traffic, parking, aesthetics, love of the way things are, or any number of other reasons.

We have carefully considered the above reasons, and designed zoning rules that should solve all these problems.

### I Like Things the Way They Are

Wingatui is beautiful the way it is, the pastoral views, country roads, quiet streets.

Our plan would certainly change that, and if you firmly believe Wingatui must retain its character we have to respect your preference.

However, we believe things can change for the better, and encourage you to consider what a pleasant place your suburb might become if it were allowed to develop. Imagine if Gladstone Road near Wingatui Hall became a little town centre: a dairy, a fish and chip shop, a Four Square, and a laundromat beside the playground; imagine a complete footpath network, safe for kids to roam about; imagine an old character home converted into a cafe with garden seating within a quick walk; imagine new paths up into the hills and parks.

That's kind of suburb that can grow organically if we allow people to build and do business, and demand quality infrastructure from developers.

Conversely, it's unlikely that Wingatui will remain idyllic forever - Mosgiel is sprawling outwards, and even if you don't like our plan compared to the way things are, you may agree that it's better than Wingatui being subsumed by bland suburbia.

### Bad Neighbours

Shading, noise, and privacy, are fundamentally neighbourly problems: if a new building is built beside you, you are the person who is primarily harmed.

Therefore, we suggest that you should be able to veto any construction that affects you directly. This guarantees you won't be harmed by tall buildings, and lets you negotiate for compensation if your neighbours want to build.

This is good if you want to build too. You don't have to ask the DCC for a resource consent for a prohibited activity - you just need your neighbour's approval.

This applies to buildings near boundaries as well as tall buildings. Currently, you cannot build within 2m of a property boundary (see [2GP](https://2gp.dunedin.govt.nz/plan/pages/plan/book.aspx?hid=1660) rule 15.6.13.1), but under our proposal, you can build anywhere on your property if you have your neighbour's consent:
> Buildings must setback 2m from the property boundary unless all neighbours whose property is within 2m of the building consent.

Notice how the new rule doesn't actually allow any new construction unless the neighbours approve it? Similarly for height, [2GP](https://2gp.dunedin.govt.nz/plan/pages/plan/book.aspx?hid=1660) rule 15.6.6.1 means no one can build above certain points on their property. We keep those exact restrictions, but allow neighbours to lift them if they want to. Under our proposal:
> A building requires the consent of a nearby resident if it intersects any line rising at 45 degrees from a point 2.5m above any point on that resident's property.

This may be confusing, so we've built a tool to let you explore how much you can build on your property under our proposal. Select the property you're interested in by zooming in on the left hand side, and you'll see a 3D model of how much you can build under our proposal. You can toggle your neighbours on and off to see what it looks like if they consent or not.

#### Development Calculator

Note, we've set an absolute maximum height of 27m. This is because, at a certain point, we believe tall building are a matter of public concern regardless of the neighbours' opinion, especially when they differ significantly from the height of the surrounding buildings.

### Parking

More construction means more people, which can mean more traffic and less parking. However, we can restrict car usage on new residents so that new people are good for the community rather than bad. We argue that Wingatui should welcome as many car-free residents as possible - they will bring shopping and activity, and contribute to the community, while not harming the existing way of life.

#### Exclusive Street Parking

We propose making all parking authorised residents only. If parking is a free-for-all, and the population is increased, new residents will inevitably buy cars and there will be a scramble for parking. By fairly allocating the parking, we can ensure everyone currently living in Wingatui with a car will be able to continue to use it.

The parking rule will be:
> Street parking is exclusively reserved for authorised residents, others can park by permission only. Street parking is to be evenly distributed to each property, minimising walking distance between parking spaces and properties, and auctioning leftovers. Parking space is allocated once then locked in.

#### New Parking

The zoning rules will not allow any new parking for any apartments.

Our building rules are slightly unconventional, in that they are voluntary. If you don't want to build tall, build non-residential, or subsidise a train you don't have to, you can just follow the existing residential zoning rules. If you chose to follow the existing rules you can build parking just like any traditional Wingatui house. However, if you voluntarily choose to follow the new zoning rules, absolutely no new parking can be provided.

This means that new development inherently relies on public transport and can't contribute new traffic.
