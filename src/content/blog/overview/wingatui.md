  Wingatui can become Dunedin's best and most vibrant township.

Wingatui is the best place for a train service in Dunedin. It's the only suburb with a train station within walking distance of homes, uniquely situated such that a train would be much faster than driving, and it has growth potential on all sides.

Below, we outline our plan to bring trains back to Wingatui, and the changes neccessary to make that happen.

## Transit Oriented Development vs Suburban Sprawl

### Transit Oriented Development

Our plan is to transform Wingatui into dense town with shops, cafes, apartments etc, and a regular train. We would limit any new traffic, and encourage new residents to walk to the station and shops. Current residents would see their property values increase significantly and benefit from the train, while enjoying a more vibrant neighbourhood without much additional traffic.

We would use a [standard Rail Towns approach](TODO!):
    - Legalise shops, restaurants, cafes etc in Wingatui
    - Allow up to 6 storey buildings up to the property boundary, with the neighbours' consent
    - Charge very high extra rates on the new tall buildings
    - Pay for train service with extra rates
    - Restrict car parking for new developments
    - Add footpaths, bike paths, and traffic calming near the station

### Suburban Sprawl

It's tempting to think that Wingatui should just remain as it is. After all, it's a fairly picturesque sleepy suburb. A community hall, a playground, pastoral views, good backyards, a racetrack, an old train station. It's clearly very pleasant and worth preserving.

But Wingatui won't exist in its current state for long. Mosgiel is sprawling eastwards, and the farmlands that contribue to Wingatui's idyllic character will soon be replaced by conventional suburban sprawl. Indeed, most of the farmland west of Wingatui Road has been rezoned for residential housing (see [2GP](https://2gp.dunedin.govt.nz/plan/pages/plan/book.aspx?exhibit=DCC2GP) rule 12.3.4.1). This will probably continue until all the farmland up to the Chain Hills is developed, as [there is a housing crisis](/posts/housing-crisis/), people need places to live, and the Taieri Plains are the easiest place to build in the city.

So if Wingatui doesn't embrace transit oriented development, it will become just another corner of Mosgiel, with all the traffic and views that that implies.
