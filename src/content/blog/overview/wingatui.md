  Wingatui can become Dunedin's best and most vibrant township.

Wingatui is the best place for a train service in Dunedin. It's the only suburb with a train station within walking distance of homes, it's uniquely situated so that a train would be much faster than driving, and it has growth potential on all sides.

Below, we outline our plan to bring trains back to Wingatui, and the changes neccessary to make that happen.

## Table of Contents

## Transit Oriented Development vs Suburban Sprawl

### Transit Oriented Development

Our plan is to transform Wingatui into dense town with shops, cafes, apartments etc, and a regular train. We would limit any new traffic, and encourage new residents to walk to the station and shops. Current residents would see their property values increase significantly and benefit from the train, while enjoying a more vibrant neighbourhood without much additional traffic.

We would use a [standard Rail Towns approach](TODO!):
    - Legalise shops, restaurants, cafes etc in Wingatui
    - Allow up to 6 storey buildings up to the property boundary, with the neighbours' consent
    - Charge very high extra rates on the new tall buildings
    - Pay for train service with extra rates
    - Restrict car parking for new developments
    - Add footpaths, bike paths, and traffic calming near the station

### Suburban Sprawl

It's tempting to think that Wingatui should just remain as it is. After all, it's a fairly picturesque sleepy suburb. A community hall, a playground, pastoral views, good backyards, a racetrack, an old train station. It's clearly very pleasant and worth preserving.

But Wingatui won't exist in its current state for long. Mosgiel is sprawling eastwards, and the farmlands that contribue to Wingatui's idyllic character will soon be replaced by conventional suburban sprawl. Indeed, most of the farmland west of Wingatui Road has been rezoned for residential housing (see [2GP](https://2gp.dunedin.govt.nz/plan/pages/plan/book.aspx?exhibit=DCC2GP) rule 12.3.4.1). This will probably continue until all the farmland up to the Chain Hills is developed, as [there is a housing crisis](/posts/housing-crisis/), people need places to live, and the Taieri Plains are the easiest place to build in the city.

So if Wingatui doesn't embrace transit oriented development, it will become just another corner of Mosgiel, with all the traffic and views that that implies.

## Speed

Before 1973, the were express trains from Monday to Friday from Wingatui to Dunedin Railway Station that took 15 minutes. In a car today, that trip takes 20 minutes, and that's not even accounting for the time it takes to find a park in the centre of town. A modern electric train might take only 12 minutes (Wingatui to Dunedin [is 12km](/assets/distance_to_wingatui.png) while the 10km from Wellington to Petone takes 11 minutes).

Consider how nice it would be to commute to town without having to drive or park in  12 minutes! Consider the freedom that children in the community would get from being able to take the train.

## Parking

More construction means more people, which can mean more traffic and less parking. However, we can restrict car usage on new residents so that new people are good for the community rather than bad. We argue that Wingatui should welcome as many car-free residents as possible - they will bring shopping and activity, and contribute to the community, while not harming the existing way of life.

### Exclusive Street Parking

On-street parking should be allocated to the homes it's adjacent to. If parking is a free-for-all, and the population is increased, new residents will inevitably buy cars and there will be a scramble for parking. By fairly allocating the parking, we can ensure everyone in Wingatui with a car will be able to continue to use it.

The parking rule will be roughly:
> Street parking is exclusively reserved for the owners of the adjacent land. Others can park there only by express permission.

This arrangement will not be perfect for everyone, as some people without driveways might currently rely on on-street parking. We suspect that this arrangement will be suitable, but if it's not, we can create a more complex rule that shares parking amongst neighbours so that sections without much land adjacent to the street will still get much of the parking.

Note that this scheme is very flexible as parking can be leased at will.

### New Parking

The zoning rules will not allow any new parking for any apartments.

Our building rules are slightly unconventional, in that they are voluntary. If you don't want to build tall, build non-residential, or subsidise a train you don't have to, you can just follow the existing residential zoning rules. If you chose to follow the existing rules you can build parking just like any traditional Wingatui house. However, if you voluntarily choose to follow the new zoning rules, absolutely no new parking can be provided.

This means that new development inherently relies on public transport and can't contribute new traffic.

## Height and Setbacks

The new zoning rules will allow dense tall construction without a resource consent. However, it will require the consent of the neighbours.

### Setbacks

Wingatui is currently zoned residential 1, which means buildings must be 4.5m from a road, 2m from a boundary, and 1m from any right of way (see 2GP 15.6.13.1). By consenting to the new rules, land owners would no longer need any setback from a road or right of way, however, they'd still need a 2m setback from the boundary unless that neighbour consented.

The boundary setback rule will be roughly:
> Buildings must setback 2m from the property boundary unless all neighbours whose property is within 2m of the building consent.

### Height

If a land owner consents to the new zoning, their maximum building height will be increased from 9m to 27m. We have decided to have a maximum building height at all because apartment towers may not be in the general public interest, whereas smaller apartments are an issue between neighbours.

However, as with setbacks, if the neighbours don't consent, there may be no additional rights to build. Again, as with setbacks, the height above the exclusion zone won't be a strict rule, but rather a area where neighbour's consent is needed. Contrast the following with 2GP rule 15.6.6.1:
> A building requires the consent of a nearby resident if it intersects any line rising at 45 degrees from a point 2.5m above any point on that resident's property.
