  Dunedin's housing capacity is low, despite the DCC's assessment
---

The DCC did a [housing capacity assessment](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/1020635/Housing-capacity-assessment-for-Dunedin-City-2023.pdf) at the [behest of the government](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/national-policy-statement-on-urban-development-2020-updated-may-2022/). It was used in the DCC's [Future Development Strategy](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1049299/Future-Development-Strategy-2024-54.pdf) to argue that no new land needs to be opened up for development.

We argue that the assessment only shows that it's possible for Dunedin residents to maintain their current level of housing with the land currently available. However, as we established [we have a housing crisis](/posts/housing-crisis), so we have to improve our housing, not just maintain it.
