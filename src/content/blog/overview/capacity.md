  Dunedin's housing capacity is low, despite the DCC's assessment
---

The DCC thinks we have enough housing, and no more land needs to be opened up for development.

Specifically, the government [told](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/national-policy-statement-on-urban-development-2020-updated-may-2022/) the DCC to do a [housing capacity assessment](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/1020635/Housing-capacity-assessment-for-Dunedin-City-2023.pdf). The DCC used this in the [Future Development Strategy](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1049299/Future-Development-Strategy-2024-54.pdf) (on page 22) to argue that no new land needs to be opened up for development.

We believe this is a big mistake given that [there is a housing crisis](/posts/housing-crisis), and in this post we outline a better way of thinking about housing capacity, then we go through the assessment in detail rebutting it.

## The More the Better

Having more housing capacity is good.

The more you add, the better the housing situation will be: more wealth, cheaper rent, less homelessness, more opportunity to start a family etc. It's never good to artifically limit housing just because you think there's enough, as that will always exaccerbate shortages, reduce wealth, and harm the poorest members of society.

The only problem is that new housing often creates externalities like traffic, infrastructure pressure, shading etc. But obviously, if there were no externalities, allowing new housing capacity would be purely positive. Thankfully, it's possible to design zoning rules with practically no negative externalities, such as apartments in the centre of the city, or along rail corridors as we advocate for here at Rail Towns.

We believe the DCC has placed an artifical limit on itself by claiming we have enough housing capacity. Yes, we probably have enough that the housing situation won't get worse, but we can aim higher: allow as much harmless housing as possible, and we can tackle some of the hardest problems in our society like homelessness, poverty, and family formation.

## Assessment Issues

The basic problem with the assessment is that it make claims that it can't back up. The assessment does a good job of arguing that we have enough developable land to keep up with expected population growth, but that's very different from proving that we have enough capacity in general. That's because only allowing enough development to keep up with population growth means we won't have enough housing to improve our city's housing situation: to put homeless people under rooves, or flatters in studio apartments, or young couples in homes. It also won't allow our city to grow in excess of expectation: people won't be able to move here or have more children here without taking housing away from others.

Below, we go through the assessment in detail describing how they overstate their case, and demonstrating that we should regard the assessment as only providing a bare minimum.

Note, we are *not* saying the assessment is incorrect in that it doesn't meet the government's standards, or that the DCC needs government scrutiny. We are saying that the DCC should have even higher capacity standards than the government, and mustn't fool itself into thinking there isn't a problem.

### Crucial Problems

#### They Don't Account for the Housing Crisis

Unfortuantely, despite the housing crisis (which we argue exists [here](/posts/housing-crisis)), the assessment doesn't take into account the fact that we currently have a shortfall of housing. From page 15:

> Previously, an estimate of Dunedinâ€™s housing shortfall has been incorporated into calculations of
housing demand. However, current data suggests that a surplus of homes have been constructed
compared to housing demand from population growth. This is the result of population growth
revisions made by Statistics New Zealand and the construction of homes continuing at a relatively
high rate despite population growth declining to a low rate. Due to this change, no adjustment has
been made to housing demand as a result of any outstanding housing shortfall/surplus.

There are many problems with this paragraph. Firstly, the idea that there is no shortfall simply doesn't fit with reality - homelessness, high rent/income and rent/mortgage payment ratios, and general housing insecurity all contradict this. Again, we reccomend our post that argues that [there is a housing crisis](/posts/housing-crisis).

Secondly they don't cite the claim that "current data suggests that a surplus of homes have been constructed compared to housing demand from population growth." One can't accept any claim without evidence, especially one which seems so unlikely in the face of a growing housing crisis.

Thirdly, there is a logical error in saying that "a surplus of homes have been constructed compared to housing demand from population growth. \[Therefore we don't need to account for a shortfall.\]" The problem is that `construction - population_growth` is the *change* in shortfall, not the shortfall itself. So they're essentially saying that the shortfall is decreasing, so we don't need to account for a shortfall. It's easy to see this is wrong: imagine there were a shortfall of 1000 homes, then the next year 500 were built, and we only needed 200 more due to population growth - there would still be a shortfall of 700 homes, and we need to account for it!

### Minor Errors

#### Construction/Consent Ratio

On page 2, the assessment makes a flawed argument for the idea that planning constraints aren't important. This is in the introduction, and is not central to the thesis of the assessment:

> Constructed homes peaked at 419 over the year to September 2022, far below
consented rates [of 641]. This suggests that constraints in the construction industry had a more significant
impact on housing supply than planning decisions.

We agree that the 222 consented by unconstructed homes were probably larglely due to constraints in the construction industry, but this doesn't say anything about the number of homes that weren't constructed due to planning decisions. Indeed, we believe that planning decisions had a far greater impact.

To justify its claim, the assessment would have to estimate the number of homes not built due to planning decisions and show it was significantly less than 222. To estimate the effect of planning restrictions we can consider how many homes would be built if restrictions were totally lifted. Imagine property owners were allowed to build as much as they like across Dunedin and Mosgiel - how much extra housing would be built? It would take a full study to estimate this, but we hope you agree that if all the best land were suddenly available to build at any height, far more than 222 extra homes would be built. Even if you disagree with our estimate, it's clear that the assessment failed to justify its claim.
