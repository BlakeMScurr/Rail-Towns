  Dunedin's housing capacity is low, despite the DCC's assessment
---

The DCC thinks we have enough housing, and no more land needs to be opened up for development.

Specifically, the government [told](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/national-policy-statement-on-urban-development-2020-updated-may-2022/) the DCC to do a [housing capacity assessment](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/1020635/Housing-capacity-assessment-for-Dunedin-City-2023.pdf). The DCC used this in the [Future Development Strategy](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1049299/Future-Development-Strategy-2024-54.pdf) (on page 22) to say that "Dunedin has sufficient development capacity over all timeframes."

We believe this is a big mistake given that [there is a housing crisis](/posts/housing-crisis), and in this post we outline a better way of thinking about housing capacity and rebut the assessment in detail.

# The More the Better

Having more housing capacity is good.

The more you add, the better the housing situation will be: more real wealth, cheaper rent, less homelessness, more opportunity to start a families etc. It's never good to artifically limit housing just because you think there's enough. At best a restrction will have no effect, but usually it will exaccerbate shortages, reduce wealth, and harm the poorest members of society.

However, it can be reasonable to oppose specifc new capactity because new housing can create [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) like traffic, infrastructure pressure, shading etc. These externalities are very different between projects, with some being much worse than others. So instead of setting a target for housing capacity, it would be more thoughtful to weigh the housing benefits of new capacity against the specific negative externalities of that project. It could always be reasonable to reject a project if the externalities are bad enough, even if housing supply is extremely low. Conversely, it's good to approve new projects if there are no negative externalities, even if current supply is high.

Thankfully, we believe it's possible to design zoning rules with practically no negative externalities, such as apartments in the centre of the city, or along rail corridors as we advocate for here at Rail Towns. These kinds of developments make infrastructure more efficient, fund public goods, and don't generate traffic. We've also carefully designed rules that allow development while preventing unwanted shading, privacy issues, ugly buildings, and more. See our [plan for Wingatui](/posts/wingatui) for an example.

We believe the DCC has placed an artifical limit on itself by claiming we have enough housing capacity. Instead of blocking development, we should encourage development where the benefits outweigh the costs, especially when there are no costs at all!

# Assessment Issues

Not only is it unreasonable to put a limit on housing capacity, but the limit that the assessment argues for is extremely low. Dunedin may have enough capacity by the Government's standards, but that's aiming far too low.

The main problem with the assessment is that it claims to determine how much housing capacity is "enough." But in fact, it only determines how much housing capacity is necessary to keep up with expected population increases.

In particular, the assessment doesn't allow for:
  - Housing the homeless
  - Improving living condision
  - Increases in inequality
  - Aspirational immigration and family formation.

Below we prove each point in detail, which shows that the assessment capacity should only be considered a bare minimum. Further critiques can be found in a [supplementary post](/posts/assessment-errors).

## They Don't Account for Homelessness

Unfortuantely, despite the housing crisis (which we argue exists [here](/posts/housing-crisis)), the assessment doesn't take into account the fact that we currently have a shortfall of housing. From page 15:

> Previously, an estimate of Dunedin’s housing shortfall has been incorporated into calculations of
housing demand. However, current data suggests that a surplus of homes have been constructed
compared to housing demand from population growth. This is the result of population growth
revisions made by Statistics New Zealand and the construction of homes continuing at a relatively
high rate despite population growth declining to a low rate. Due to this change, no adjustment has
been made to housing demand as a result of any outstanding housing shortfall/surplus.

There are many problems with this paragraph. Firstly, the idea that there is no shortfall simply doesn't fit with reality - homelessness, high rent/income and rent/mortgage payment ratios, and general housing insecurity all contradict this. In reality, there are at least 400 people, probably 1500 people in urgent need of housing in Dunedin, see our [housing crisis post](/posts/housing-crisis) for details.

Secondly they don't cite the claim that "current data suggests that a surplus of homes have been constructed compared to housing demand from population growth." One can't accept any claim without evidence, especially one which seems so unlikely in the face of a growing housing crisis.

Thirdly, there is a logical error in saying that "a surplus of homes have been constructed compared to housing demand from population growth. \[Therefore we don't need to account for a shortfall.\]" The problem is that `construction - population_growth` is the *change* in shortfall, not the shortfall itself. So they're essentially saying that the shortfall is decreasing, so we don't need to account for a shortfall. It's easy to see this is wrong: imagine there were a shortfall of 1000 homes, then the next year 500 were built, and we only needed 200 more due to population growth - there would still be a shortfall of 700 homes, and we need to account for it!

## They Don't Allow Improved Conditions

The assessment uses a 2019 survey called The Housing We'd Choose to estimate demand for housing (see page 14, section 4.1.3). Unfortunately, this survey is not cited, and doesn't even seem to be published. But we can learn about its methodology by using a [DCC newsletter](https://archive.is/xyd10) and [another publication](https://archive.is/axNiH) called The Housing We'd Choose which cites and claims to replicate the Dunedin study for Hamilton.

The problem is that the survey is used to indicate what kinds of housing people want, but forces people to only choose housing they can currently afford. If we assume people only want the housing they can currently afford, then limit supply because we "have enough" on that basis, it will be impossible for peoples' housing situation to improve in general. There simply won't physically be enough housing for any to have more without taking it away from others, and it's highly unlikely that it will become more affordable.

From the newsletter:
> Based on their financial situation (household income, debts and assets), respondents were presented with a series of dwelling options that matched their affordability profile, living arrangements and housing preferences.

And from the Hamilton study:
> The survey then presented each respondent with a series of dwelling options that matched their
affordability profile. The dwellings also accounted for their living situation and other preferences.
However, if a respondents (sic) desires did not match their budget, the survey provided options across the city
that did match their budget.

Let's imagine an example. Suppose we had a small town of 1000 where everyone lives in tents and shacks except the rich mayor who has a house, and construction is illegal. The mayor comissions a study to figure out whether we need new housing capacity. Since survey respondents are only shown affordable options, almost everyone is forced to choose some kind of tent or shack. Thankfully, there are enough shacks and tents to meet consumer demands, so there's no need to legalise construction.

This is exactly the dynamic at play here in Dunedin.

## They Don't Account for Increased Inequality

There is no mention of inequality at all in the assessment.

This is crucial, because if housing supply is fixed at the current amount, and income inequality is increased, poorer people will be able to afford less housing. Inequality [has risen](https://www.inequality.org.nz/understand/what-is-the-history-of-inequality-in-new-zealand/#:~:text=As%20the%20graph%20above%20shows,and%20a%20higher%20minimum%20wage.) in New Zealand over the past 40 years as measured by the Gini coefficient, and it's possible that this trend will continue.

Imagine, for example, if all high earners in Dunedin suddenly doubled their income. Anyone earning 100k and living in an apartment would surely choose to live in a large house instead. Now imagine what happens to low earners living in a flat - suddenly they can't compete with high earners who want the place all to themselves. If there's no new construction keeping up with the high earners' demand for more housing, low earners will have to make do with less housing, or perhaps no housing.

### They Impose a Limit on Families and Migration

The assessment uses a "high-medium" growth scenario, in section 4.2:

> Dunedin’s population is expected to grow at a relatively high rate between 2024 and 2034, before
slowing to a low growth rate between 2034 and 2054... The overall impact of modelled population trends for Dunedin is an average annual growth of 1,054 people per year over 2024-27 (sic), decreasing to a growth of 169 people per year between 2034 and 2054.

This is probably a reasonable estimate, given current trends in migration and family formation. However, we shouldn't use this estimate as a limit to housing capacity, as that will actively limit our population growth, which limits family formation and migration.

To be specific, if we only allow for enough housing to house an addtional 1,054 people per year for 10 years, then 139 for 20 years, we're limiting ourselves to only 13320 new people. This makes it impossible to to have any additional migration, or births without harming the housing situation.

We believe Dunedin should aspire to be a place where people can have families, and be a place people want to move to. The exact number is up for debate, but note that [Queenstown 3.7x'ed](https://rep.infometrics.co.nz/queenstown-lakes-district/population/growth) from 1996 to 2024, and we are limiting ourselves to a 10% population increase. That not only guarantees that Dunedin will not become a dynamic, nationally important city, but it forces many people to choose between staying in their home town or having a family.
