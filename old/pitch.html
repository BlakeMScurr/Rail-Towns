<p>Our goal is to solve Dunedin's housing crisis by rebuilding our train network and making abundant building space availabe around stations.</p>

<p>This involves creating a new funding system for rail, where property owners voluntarily agree to very high rates in exchange for building rights. Creating this system will require convincing property owners, the DCC, and probably the ORC.</p>

<p>Our first phase will be largely philanthropic, as we will coordinate campaigns in existing suburbs like Mosgiel, Caversham, Green Island, South Dunedin, and Wingatui to create 2GP plan changes that will enable rail service to those suburbs.</p>

Here, we aim to work with land owners to get extremely outsized land valuations for their land, and take a cut of land sales contingent on a plan change. Burnside in particular could turn from industrial land to high rises, increasing value enormously.</p>

<p>We aim for a valuation increase of at least $500m and a consultant fee of 10%, giving plausible one-time revenue of $50m. If successful, we intend to spread our system throughout the province and country for repeated revenue.</p>

<p>We intend to complete phase 1 with no outside funding, since, once the community rail advocacy groups are established, they will need time to work through their problems on their own before going to council.
