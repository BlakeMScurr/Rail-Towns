The goal of Rail Towns is to create a pattern of urban development where incentives are aligned such that increased development in one area confers a concrete economic advantage to another area, and does not cause harm. This is because the main reason for the housing crisis is local political restrictions on building, resulting in low supply elasticity and high prices, and the political restrictions are caused in part by the harm that development has. We do not allege that the landowning class uses political mechanisms to increase the value of their assets, and in the case of Dunedin we haven't seen evidence for that. However we can know the tree by its fruit, and the DCC councillors tend not to take the side of development and housing when the occassion arises. In particular, in the case of heritage buildings, there is little acknowledgement of the harm caused by building and demolitions restrictions. Indeed, Lee Vandervis, who is typically the most ardent opponent of council overreach, generally argues in favour of heritage restrictions, and voices opposition only insofar as they become counter productive by being so onerous as to cause demolition by neglect. Councillors encourage heritage restrictions in the name of the public interest, but rarely favour freedom of development as being in the public interest.

It's our contention that development is in fact in the public interest, especially for renters and homeless. However, we acknowledge that a large contingent of Dunedin voters and submitters want to retain old buildings for aesthetic and sentimental reasons. So infill in the City Centre at scale is not politically feasible. However, there are locations where development is likely to be a public good rather than a public bad, such as at Burnside, or potentially on the outer edges of the city, or some town centres. In these places we can likely have genuinely high density without much downside if we build the density alongside rail service.

That was a rambling introduction to the general purpose of rail towns, which is essentially to have large development potential without harming others, so that development can become politically feasible.

A crucial part of making development politically feasible is making sure that some of the benefits of development acrue to people other than those who are making the development. In particular, in the case of rail, if the development funds the rail services, then more development means more services, so the population along the rail line should be in favour, while the rest of the city is somewhat is favour.

This works fine along a single line, where each station can cover the marginal cost of a service stopping at the station, and cover a pro rata portion of the other costs, which either increases service or decreases costs for other stations. Note, this works due to the efficient scaling of rail - where the marginal cost of capacity generally decreases with capacity - i.e., a 2 car train is less than 5x more expensive than a 10 car train.

However, there's a problem with a fork in the line. If there are two lines that merge into one, there seems to be inherent competition between the two forks, where cooperation between fork A and the main line comes at the expense of fork B, since B can't cooperate as much with the main line to reduce their costs. There are solutions to this, but all solutions appear to violate at least one of the criteria that we want out of a rail funding model.

The three criteria are: all cooperation opportunities are used; all development is pareto efficient in the short term; and all development is pareto efficient in the long term. I.e., cooperation, short-pareto, and long-pareto efficient.

Cooperation efficiency means that if there are any two lines that could be combined to improve outcomes for both lines, they are combined. For simplicity here we define improvement as more services and lower cost, and don't consider the journey time.

Short pareto efficiency means that no development on any line can reduce the service to another line. That is, for a given amount of service and development, if more development is added, the service levels and prices can't increase for any station.

Long pareto efficiency means that no development can cause an increase in the future costs of service at any station. That is, for a given level of development at stations A and B, and a given set of marginal costs of service at station A while development and service at B are fixed, there is no additional amount of development at station B that could increase any marginal cost of service at station A. Note that when I say "marginal cost" here.

Long and short parto efficiency has a similar purpose, which is to ensure that no station has any reason to oppose development at any other station. Cooperation efficiency is a more utilitarian principle, stating that we should aim to benefit from cooperation.

The reason why this is called the "forked line trilemma" is that it appears that we can fulfill any 2 criteria but not three.

To get cooperation and short pareto efficiency, we use an enduring priority list. There is a list of the order in which each fork cooperated with the main line to get a shared service. That is recorded, and becomes permanent, such that when contracts are renegotiated, the order of which fork gets the best cooperation is the order of the priority list. This achieves cooperation efficiency because every cooperation opportunity is exhausted. It achieves short pareto efficiency because the quality of cooperation for each fork is locked in by the priority list. It fails to achieve long pareto efficiency because if one fork takes a spot on the list, that spot is no longer available for another fork, decreasing the future gains from cooperation for that other fork.

It is not quite a true trilemma, in that long pareto efficiency seems to imply short pareto efficency (I haven't quite made myself sure of this), and in any case, if there were a cooperation and long pareto efficient funding model without short parto efficiency, it likely wouldn't be interesting, as short pareto efficiency captures the concrete harms that are likely to cause political stalling.

We can achieve arguably short and long pareto efficiency by simply by simply never cooperating, and having each fork start its own line towards the final destination station.

A similar interesting model is where the cooperation happens, but the cost born on the fork is similar to the cost it would pay for its own full dedicated express service, and the main line gets no benefit from the cooperation either. However, the double paid money goes into a separate fund (for the whole system or perhaps city as a whole), until the other fork catches up, gets the same service, at which point the gains from cooperation can accrue to the participants (in some kind of equitable, pro rata kind of way). This system has short pareto efficiency because no one is actually using up cooperation advantage by developing. Moreover, the service is a function of development at a point in time, as opposed to having enduring state, which goes some way towards guaranteeing long pareto efficiency. Finally, it concretely benefits from full cooperation efficiency, though that benefit doesn't accrue to cooperators.

I currently prefer the enduring priority model. The main disadvantage is that it lacks long pareto efficiency, and that it has suboptimal cooperation, in that there are times when a fork will have a highly valuable service that it can't cooperate on because it lacks priority, such that if priority were shifted the fork and the main branch would benefit to a greater degree than the other fork would suffer in monetary/service terms. However, that price seems worthwhile for the benefits, namely that it is short pareto efficient and fairly cooperation efficient. Further, it's short pareto efficient to branching - you can actually add branched services that don't harm the existing network. Finally it's simple and fits with a fairly normal moral principle about established rights - that things ought to be as they are or better, and newcomers shouldn't harm the current system/society.

OK good! So it's determined.
