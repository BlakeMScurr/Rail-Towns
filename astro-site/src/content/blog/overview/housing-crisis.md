  The housing crisis is real and harmful.

Dunedin has a housing crisis.

This post presents some evidence for that for the skeptical.

## Appeal to Authority

Labour, National, Act, and Te Pāti Māori all agree that there is a housing crisis in New Zealand, and that the solution is to add supply.

Chris Bishop, the current Minister for Housing in the National Government [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASbAeS07L6M):

> Our country's collective failure to build enough houses has significantly impacted almost every aspect of New Zealand society: homelessness; inequality; poverty; poor productivity; economic growth; . . . and intergenerational mobility.

Labour's [priorities page](https://archive.is/UpPrJ) says:

> New Zealand’s housing crisis has been decades in the making ...

> To make housing more affordable for both renters and first-home buyers, we are ramping up housing supply.

The Act Party's [housing page](https://archive.is/KHnN2) says:

> The fact is we’re simply not building enough.

> ACT is the only party that offers real solutions to the housing crisis.

Te Pāti Māori's [policy](https://archive.is/665ea) says:

> New Zealanders all know there is a housing crisis ... We will build 2000 houses on our ancestral lands

By contrast, we believe [New Zealand First's policy](https://archive.is/MnCjl) and [The Green Party's policy](https://archive.is/3ZrJW) deemphasise supply in favour of other issues, though both include some measures to increase supply, and the Greens acknowledge a housing crisis. 

This means 100 out of 123 seats in Parliament are held by parties who acknowledge a housing crisis, whose primary goal is to increase the supply of housing. This doesn't prove that there is a housing crisis or that supply should increase. But the fact that many people with different ideologies have come to the same conclusion may impact your thinking.

## Statistics

### Census Data

The most detailed data on homelessness comes from a [2018 report](https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/Severe-Housing-Deprivation-2018-Estimate-Report.pdf) funded by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development based on census data. This is the most reputable information we've been able to find on the subject.

It estimates that there were 48 people without shelter in Dunedin, 216 in temporary accomodation like the [Night Shelter](https://dunedinnightshelter.co.nz/), and 432 "sharing accomodation" which is intended to capture people living on friends' couches etc.

This suggests that even in 2018 there was a shortage of at least 696 rooms to rent on the private market. Since then homelessness has likely increased: the [ODT estimated](https://web.archive.org/web/20231220155939/https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/homelessness%E2%80%99-perfect-storm) that there were 1500 homeless in 2023; and most residents will agree visible homelessness increased from 2018 to 2023, considering the encampment at The Oval, and increased begging on George Street.

Furthermore, adding 1500 rooms to the housing supply may not be enough, as higher income renters will consume some of that supply by renting larger homes.

### Inflation Data

The Reserve Bank maintains in [inflation calculator](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/monetary-policy/about-monetary-policy/inflation-calculator) that lets you see how prices have changed over time in New Zealand. Using this, you can find that housing has increased by 4.82x in the 25 years from 1999 Q2 and 2024 Q2, whereas wages have only increased 2.4x, meaning housing prices have increased approximately 2x with respect to wages.

From the Reserve Bank's data on interest rates, the rate for a 2 year fixed mortgage in June 2024 was $7.35%$, whereas in June 1999 it was $7.66%$. This means the repayments on a $300,000 home in 1999 would be 

<!-- The formula for amortised debt payments:
// Formula taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator

calculate_payment = (interest_rate, principle, years) => {
    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12 // we use /12 rather than 12th root because of the banks' scam around nominal interest rates vs effective interest rates
    months = years * 12
    return principle * monthly_interest_rate / (1- Math.pow((1 + monthly_interest_rate), -months))
}
calculate_payment(0.0766, 300000, 30)
calculate_payment(0.0735, 600000, 30)

### DCC Figures

## Direct Evidence

Since statistics can be subject to doubt, it's useful to consider what you can verify with your own observation and research. We argue that you can easily see for yourself that high housing prices are causing major harm in Dunedin.

### Homelessness

Homelessness is the most harmful result of the housing crisis.

You can easily observe that Dunedin has a homelessness problem. The oval encampment was the most obvious instantiation, and beggars on George Street and elsewhere are all homeless or struggling with housing in my experience.

I encourage you to give a little money to someone on the street, and respectfully ask them their housing situation - they will almost always talk about cost and availability. While these people generally have other problems too, it's always clear that their personal crises would be mitigated by abundant housing.

### Rent Costs

High rents are the next largest harm. It's easy to calculate the kind of lifestyle our disadvantaged residents can afford, and I encourage you to verify this for yourself.

#### Beneficiaries

Imagine a 24 year old on the jobseeker's benefit. [They get $307.87](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-cut-out-points/jobseeker-support-cut-out-points-current.html) per week. This person has to share a bathroom and kitchen with strangers, as the cheapest place on TradeMe with its own bathroom as of October 15th was [$240](https://archive.is/ktoe8), and the cheapest with its own kitchen was [$325](https://archive.is/6B31L). This person can only realistically afford a room in a large boarding house style flat, which start at around $150 per week, giving ~$160 for all bills, food, transport, and emergencies.

Not everyone will find this morally objectionable - they have enough to live, after all, and perhaps ought to be working. But it's clearly a precarious unpleasant situation, where one crisis could lead to homelessness.

#### Minimum Wage Workers

Now imagine a minimum wage worker working 40 hours per week. This kind of person is the backbone of our economy, and should be able to afford a reasonable life - in my opinion this includes a bathroom and kitchen that is not shared with strangers. However, at $23.15/hour, [after tax](https://www.paye.net.nz/calculator/) they only earn $780 per week, meaning that if they want their own bathroom and tiny kitchen, they'll have to spend around half their income on housing. The [AA estimates](https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/the-cost-of-running-a-vehicle/) that a car costs ~$154 per week to run, leaving only ~$300 for all other expenses.

It's likely that despite working full time, this person will be unable to save, and will have to tread water until they find a way to improve their circumstances.
